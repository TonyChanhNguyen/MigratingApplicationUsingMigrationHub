Agents capture system configuration, system performance, running processes, and details of the network connections between systems. Agents support most Linux and Windows operating systems, and you can deploy them on physical on-premises servers, Amazon EC2 instances, and virtual machines.\nThe Discovery Agent runs in your local environment and requires root privileges. When you start the Discovery Agent, it registers with the Application Discovery Service endpoint, arsenal-discovery..amazonaws.com, and pings the service at 15 minute intervals for configuration information. When you send a command that tells an agent to start data collection, it starts collecting data for the host or VM where it resides. Collection includes system specifications, times series utilization or performance data, network connections, and process data. You can use this information to map your IT assets and their network dependencies. All of these data points can help you determine the cost of running these servers in AWS and also plan for migration.\nData is transmitted securely by the Discovery Agents to Application Discovery Service using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. Agents are configured to upgrade automatically when new versions become available. You can change this configuration setting if desired.\nContent  3.1 Enable Athena integration 3.2 Install ADS Agent to VMs 3.3 Browse discovered data 3.4 Viewing network connections 3.5 EC2 instance recommendations 3.6 Explore data using Athena  "

Additoinally, we can notice that it is also communicating with 192.168.0.246 (the Bastion server) and 192.168.1.250 (DNS server).\n We will want to group wordpress-web and wordpress-db together as they comprise the front and backend of the application. Go back to the Server list tab and select those 2 servers.\n  Then click Group as application.   Choose Group as a new application.\n  Input Application name Wordpress.\n  Click Group.   Create an application group for the ofbiz application comprised of the 2 ofbiz servers.   For actual production migration it is recommended that the Discovery Agent server data should be collected for two to six weeks before you can use the network diagram to view established connection patterns.\n\r"

You specify what tables (or views) and schemas to use for your migration and any special processing, such as logging requirements, control table data, and error handling.\nWhen creating a migration task, you need to know several things:\n Before you can create a task, you must create a source endpoint, a target endpoint, and a replication instance. You can specify many task settings to tailor your migration task. You can set these by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS DMS API. These settings include specifying how migration errors are handled, error logging, and control table information. After you create a task, you can run it immediately. The target tables with the necessary metadata definitions are automatically created and loaded, and you can specify ongoing replication. By default, AWS DMS starts your task as soon as you create it. However, in some situations, you might want to postpone the start of the task. For example, when using the AWS CLI, you might have a process that creates a task and a different process that starts the task based on some triggering event.

	"content": "Let us explore the EC2 instance recommendation feature in Migration Hub to estimate the cost of running your existing servers in AWS. This feature analyzes the details about each server, including server specification, CPU, and memory utilization data. The compiled data is then used to recommend the least expensive Amazon EC2 instance type that can handle the existing performance workload.\nPrerequisites Before you can get Amazon EC2 instance recommendations, you must have data about your on-premises servers in Migration Hub. This data can come from the discovery tools (AWS Application Discovery Agent or Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector) or from Migration Hub import. For the purpose of this lab we going to use Application Discovery Agent.\nOverview of the 3 options:  AWS Application Discovery Agent is software that you install on on-premises servers and VMs targeted for discovery and migration. Agents support most Linux and Windows operating systems, and you can deploy them on physical on-premises servers, Amazon EC2 instances, and virtual machines. Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector is an on-premises application that collects information through agentless methods about your on-premises environment. You install the Agentless Collector as a virtual machine (VM) in your VMware vCenter Server environment using an Open Virtualization Archive (OVA) file. AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) import allows you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the Agentless Collector or Discovery Agent, so you can perform migration assessment and planning directly from your imported data. You also can group your devices as applications and track their migration status.  Generating Amazon EC2 Recommendations:   Go to Migration Hub.\n  At Asset feature. Choose EC2 instance recommendations .   At EC2 instance recommendations interface, choose Average utilization under Sizing preferences.\n  Choose US West (Oregon) at Region.\n  Choose Shared instances at Tenancy.\n  Choose On-Demand at Pricing model.\n  Then, click on Export recommendations.   When the process is complete, your browser will automatically download a compressed archive (ZIP) file, containing a comma-separated values (CSV) file with your recommendations.\n  Checking recommendation file, there are analysis and recommendations for your systems. Example: When checking column P name Recommendation.EC2.Instance.Model, it recommend the model for each instance can be at least suitable with this system.\n   Server.HostName Current model Recommendation model     ofbiz-db.onpremsim.env t3.small t3a.nano   ofbiz-web.onpremsim.env t3.medium t3a.medium   wordpress-web.onpremsim.env t3.small t3a.micro   wordpress-db.onpremsim.env t3.small t3a.nano      The results of this analysis only provide recommendations and do not obligate you to any further actions.

Both apps are using a DNS entry as a connection hostname. In a real-world application migration, once you have completed all of your testing and are ready to fully transition your databases to Aurora, you should perform the shutdown of the source servers and update the DNS records properly to reflect the new database servers running in Aurora.\n From Bastion Host, SSH to instance name wordpress-db. Check the current database DNS record running following command from the putty terminal:  nslookup wordpress-db Let\u0026rsquo;s create a variable (ADDR) using the RDS endpoint. See again at step 25 of Finnalize Cutover and archive servers.  ADDR=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;REPLACE THIS WITH WORDPRESS ENDPOINT\u0026gt;\u0026#34; Then, run the following commands to update the DNS record:  HOST=\u0026#34;wordpress-db.onpremsim.env\u0026#34;\rsudo touch /tmp/nsupdate.txt\rsudo chmod 666 /tmp/nsupdate.txt\recho \u0026#34;server dns.onpremsim.env\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /tmp/nsupdate.txt\recho \u0026#34;update delete $HOST A\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/nsupdate.txt\recho \u0026#34;update delete $HOST PTR\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/nsupdate.txt\recho \u0026#34;update add $HOST 86400 CNAME $ADDR.\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/nsupdate.txt\recho \u0026#34;send\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /tmp/nsupdate.txt\rsudo nsupdate /tmp/nsupdate.txt Verify the DNS name resolution again.  nslookup wordpress-db It was updated to a CNAME pointing to your Aurora database (compare the output with the previous step).\nShutdown the source database server.  sudo shutdown -h now From the Bastion Host, test the application using Chrome web browser with this URL http://wordpress-web.onpremsim.env/.  This is the expected screen if the migration was successful: Congratulations, you had migrated your enterprise servers into AWS successfully. "
