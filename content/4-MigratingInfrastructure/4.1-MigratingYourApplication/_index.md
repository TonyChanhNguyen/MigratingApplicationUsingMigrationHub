### MGN
[AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)](https://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service/) is a highly automated solution that simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating and modernizing applications. It allows companies to migrate a large number of physical, virtual, and cloud servers without compatibility issues, performance disruption, or long cutover windows. AWS MGN continuously replicates source servers to your AWS account. When youâ€™re ready, it automatically converts and launches your servers on AWS so you can quickly benefit from the cost savings, productivity, resilience, and agility of the Cloud. In addition, AWS MGN allows you to modernize launched applications by running pre-configured actions.
